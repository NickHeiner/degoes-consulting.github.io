                  "Compatibility means deliberately repeating other peoples' mistakes," said Wheeler. Not only a pithy aphorism, but literally true. And today, almost fifty years after the birth of unix, we still make it a point to deliberately repeat mistakes - even if we don't count unix itself among them. Why do we still program to teletypes? Why must we concern ourselves with newlines in file names? Why is it still an everyday occurrence to find the arrow keys don't work? Why did scala intentionally repeat most of java's mistakes? How is it that so much effort is poured into validation of inputs, yet it's never enough? How can it be that we know the benefits of types, yet only enjoy those benefits in a minority of environments? Why is it so difficult to clamber above the maelstrom of complexity - and stay there?
                  <br>
                  Can't we have it both ways - make improvements without sacrificing compatibility? 
                  <br>
                  In fact, we can have it both ways. The subject of my talk is the almost unexplored frontier through which we can disrupt the endless perpetuation of mistakes of the past: ipecac for the ouroboros.

                  Types in functional programs are not only means to verifying and documenting our code, they can also help in *writing* them! This way of working is usually termed "hole-driven development". The reason is that you annotate those parts of your program which still need to be written with "holes". Afterwards, you can query the compiler and interact with your code until no hole exists. In some cases, the code can be automatically written for you.

                  Hole-driven development environments are available for many languages, including Agda, Idris and Haskell. In this talk we will look at a practical example of this methodology using Haskell and its Emacs mode enhanced with the ghc-mod add-in. Get ready to unveil the hidden power of types!

                Reconciling conflicts in eventually consistent distributed systems can be messy adventure, but conflict-free replicated datatypes (CRDTâs) offer a solution where updates are accepted without remote synchronization and replicas properly converge into an equivalent state. Riak Data Types bring CRDTs to the server side, making data modeling simpler and skipping the need to roll your own conflict resolution logic. More than anything, these data types make some of the recent research in strong eventual consistency real and practical, and Iâll demo #howitdoesit.

                Due to the high demand for performance, programs in the Scientific Computing community are usually written in Fortran or C/C++ for execution on CPUs and in CUDA when GPUs are targeted. Though, why not use Haskell and see where it stands? We will take a quick look at code complexity and performance results of the implementations of a simple diffusion algorithm in Fortran/CUDA and Haskell.

                We all know that making a method tail recursive is one way to ensure you donât SOE when recursing. However, sometimes itâs either not possible or convenient to make your methods tail recursive, and this is where trampolining can help.  Beware though, his is not always a solution, for instance when using a Monad Transformer stack.  This is where the Free Monad can come to the rescue, and weâll take a look at examples of both trampolines working and not working, as well as using Free in a non trampolined way to save your stack.

However, many properties, typically those that depend on relationships between program values are impossible, or at the very least, cumbersome to encode within Haskell's type system. Refinement types enable the specification and verification of value-dependent properties by extending Haskell's type system with logical predicates drawn from efficiently decidable logics. In this talk, we will start with a high level description of Refinement Types. Next, we will present an overview of LiquidHaskell, a refinement type checker for Haskell. In particular, we will describe the kinds of properties that can be checked, ranging from generic requirements like like totality (will 'head' crash?) and termination (will 'mergeSort' loop forever?), to application specific concerns like memory safety (will my code 'SEGFAULT' ?) and data structure correctness invariants for various libraries like containers, hscolour, bytestring, text, vector-algorithms and xmonad.</td>

Rust is a new experimental programming language currently being designed by Mozilla Research and the language's active community. The language is inspired by several variants of ML, Haskell, C++, as well as novel research ideas about the performance and safety of programming languages. One of the key features is the reification of memory as an explicit part of the language semantics. This provides low level control of memory allocation without sacrificing the safety of garbage collection. The goal of this workshop is to show how we can use Rust to write high level code that provides excellent safety and performance.</td>

In the âAlgebra of Programmingâ approach, pioneered by Richard Bird, Oege de Moor, and Lambert Merteens, we can derive efficient functional programs by a series of algebraic manipulations, much schoolchildren can take a typical algebraic function, âsolve for xâ and then simplify. In the early-mid 90s, this school of research turned its attention to the problem of parallel computing and developed many of the foundations for what is now called MapReduce. This workshop will run through some famous and nifty algorithms and derivations, parallel and sequential alike. Attendees should walk away with a few weird tricks to level up their equational reasoning in everyday programming contexts, and hopefully enough intuition to dive more deeply into this rich body of literature.</td>

But, once that Haskeller has drunk the well-typed Kool-Aid, where to go from there? The answer: even more types! A Generalized Algebraic Datatype (GADT), at its core, allows a compiler to make different assumptions about types within different branches of a pattern match. Leveraging this power allows a programmer to encode detailed invariants in a datatype or algorithm and have these invariants checked at compile time. Clever use of GADTs also lets you remove certain uses of unsafeCoerce, as long as these can be proved safe. This workshop will be a hands-on, interactive tutorial on using Haskell GADTs in a practical setting.</td>

We'll take a tour through the stack and exercise the various parts individually, before diving in to write a complete HTTP application. We'll see how easy it is to write applications which take full advantage of the HTTP standards, and then we'll look at ways of extending our application out past the world of RFCs in to the world of hypermedia - and we'll do it with graphs! After this session you'll be comfortable building an application using Freya, and you'll almost certainly have come up with some great ideas for how Freya, and the graph based approach to logical design, could be extended to do even more.</td>

Clojure is a relatively new, powerful, dynamic Lisp dialect that compiles to many target environments, including the JVM, JavaScript, and the CLR. The most important single principle behind Clojure is its simplicity: its abstractions are simple and orthogonal, which means no compromise on power. A la carte polymorphism, careful support for names and namespaces, the reference succession model, and a wide selection of small, composable protocols make Clojure programming swift, surgical, and accurate. Perfect for game development! So are you ready, brave programmers? It's time to get atomic!</td>

                  "Programming in Scala", by Martin Odersky et al., is one of the most comprehensive and the de facto reference for Scala. However, the book, originally published in 2008 for Scala 2.7.2, has not been updated since its second edition in 2010, covering up until Scala 2.8.1. In the meantime, Scala has had 3 major releases with numerous fresh and advanced features. While we wait for a third edition of "Programming in Scala" to describe all the latest and greatest Scala features introduced in the last 4 years, this talk presents the main features introduced in Scala: 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11, as well as an exciting peek into 2.12 and beyond (What's in Scala's future?).

                  Free monads, generic programming, fix-points and coproducts of data types are usually considered advanced topics for a Haskell programmer. In this talk we will look at these concepts from an unifying lens: combining and enriching pattern functors. A pattern functor is the stripped-down description of a data type: only the shape of the constructors remain, but all the recursive structure is gone. Using Haskell, we can manipulate pattern functors to create new data types at will.

The functional programming community has invested a lot of time and energy into up-front-correctness guarantees: types and the like. Unfortunately, absolutely correct software is time-consuming to write and expensive as a result. Fault-tolerant systems achieve system-total reliability by accepting that sub-components will fail and planning for that failure as a first-class concern of the system. As companies embrace the wave of "as-a-service" architectures, failure of sub-systems become a more pressing concern. Using examples from heavy industry, aeronautics and telecom systems, this talk will explore how you can design for fault-tolerance and how functional programming techniques get us most of the way there.</td>

                  âProgramming is about abstraction.â But what is abstraction about? Surely not just programming. Why do we need it, why do we keep reinventing it? How do we even recognize it when we see it, across so many domains? When something is more abstract, it is not necessarily more useless, even though, definitionally, it is further removed from any specific use. How can that even be the case? Too often, when we teach functional programming, we are met with the response âyou have taught me some abstractions, but not what they are good for.â Certain realms of mathematics, such as category theory, often elicit similar responses. This talk is an investigation into how to consider not only abstractions, but the process of applying them.

It turns out the result is faster, more robust, and massively easier to maintain. Elm's simple design means that even a functional programming novice can quickly get up to speed on its static type inference, pervasive immutability, and first-class FRP system. It's not only an excellent language, but also a great introductory FP language that any JavaScript developer can pick up. This talk dives into the nuts and bolts of shipping a production web app in Elm, including questions like why you should choose Elm, how you transition from imperative architecture to FRP, and to what extent you can leverage the JavaScript library ecosystem without sacrificing your functional invariants.

                  Writing correct concurrent, fault-tolerant, scalable applications is no simple task. The struggle is generally the result of using the wrong tools or wrong level of abstraction. The Actor based concurrency model aims to simplify this process. The actor model is a mathematical model of concurrent computation originated in 1973 by Carl Hewitt, Peter Bishop, and Richard Steiger. Actor programming is one of the most widely applicable programming models, which provides support for concurrency, by improving distribution, error detection, and fault tolerance. As such, itâs a good fit for the kinds of programming problems we find ourselves faced with in todayâs increasingly distributed world Actors raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications. This presentation will introduce concepts in architecture such as immutability, isolation and asynchronous processing utilizing tools such as Akka.NET which is a .NET port of the popular JVM framework Akka. The goal is to provide solid knowledge of and foundation for the Actor model. Following the presentation, attendees will take with them enough material to start to use and leverage the Actor model to write successful concurrent applications.

                  FP is often glibly described as "programming with functions", but we can equivalently say that FP is about programming with *values*. Functions are values, failures are values, effects are values, and indeed programs themselves can be treated as values. This talk explores some consequences of this idea of programs-as-values by looking at *doobie*, a pure-functional database library for Scala. We will examine the low-level implementation via free monads over algebras of the JDBC types, and show how this naturally enables an expressive and safe high-level API with familiar, lightweight, and composable abstractions including streaming result sets, and trivial compatibility with other pure libraries like Remotely and HTTP4s. Even if you are not in the market for a database layer, this talk will provide a practical outline for a general solution to dealing with terrible APIs (like JDBC) in a principled way.

We'll discuss how to learn a new language, considerations when introducing things to production, and come up with some ideas for Ruby and its ecosystem. Plan on dipping your toes in Elixir, Go, Haskell, Ruby, Rust, and Scala during the session.

                  From choosing a functional database to building http apis and designing templates and stylesheetsâit is possible these days, to stay entirely in FP land! In this talk I will share my experience in building functional prototypes with Clojure & Clojurescript using the following libraries: Datomic, Ring, Om, and Garden. Iâll discuss how we can trade popular databases, web toolkits, template engines, and even less and sass in favor of simpler libraries that embrace immutable data as a âSequence of Valuesâ.

                  Types remain a highly contentious issue for programmers in industry. Rails and Python have massive communities, and drive high-profile, high-traffic, successful businesses, such as GitHub, Reddit, and Dropbox. Clearly, dynamic languages are a better choice than Java or C; unless, of course, we count the myriad more businesses powered by 90s statically typed languages (e.g. Java). This statement will infuriate some engineers and academics, as we all know that Hindley-Milner type systems are the only type systems that reduce defects and improve code quality. In this talk, we'll take a look at type systems through a different lens: how type systems are actually a business decision that is frequently cast as an emotional decision.

                  At the heart of intuitionistic type theory lies an intuitive semantics called the âmeaning explanations." Crucially, when meaning explanations are taken as definitive for type theory, the core notion is no longer âproofâ but âverificationâ. Weâll explore how type theories of this sort arise naturally as enrichments of logical theories with further judgements, and contrast this with modern proof-theoretic type theories which interpret the judgements and proofs of logics, not their propositions and verifications. Expect the following questions to be answered: What is the difference between a judgement and a proposition? What is a meaning explanation? What is the difference between a proof and a verification? The so-called semantical approach to type theory is, in the speaker's view, more immediately philosophically acceptable than the modern syntactic one, and also provides a basis for a future where partiality and other effects may be treated naturally through refinement and behavioral typing, rather than by means of term-level monads and similar kludges.

Using ClojureScript and Om allowed the app to be written in a declarative, concise manner, taking full advantage of JavaScript interoperability, as well as Clojureâs awesome built-in features such as persistent data structures and the async module.

                  R&amp;D on reactive programming is growing and this has delivered many language constructs, libraries and tools. Scala programmers can use threads, timers, actors, futures, promises, observables, the async construct, and others. Still it seems to us that the state of the art is not mature: reactive programming is relatively hard, and confidence in correct operation depends mainly on extensive testing. Better support for reasoning about correctness would be useful to address timing dependent issues. The Algebra of Communicating Processes (ACP) has a potential to improve this: it lets one concisely specify event handling and concurrency, and it facilitates reasoning about parallel systems. There is an ACP-based extension to Scala named SubScript. We show how it helps describing the internal behavior of Akka actors, and how it combines with futures.

Having the opportunity to start on a library like this from scratch gives us many delicious opportunities to rethink some past decisions, and this is allowing us to innovate in unexpected ways.

                  Design patterns are a useful way to organize software.  Unfortunately, "gang-of-four"-like patterns are not composable, due to side-effects. In a pure (i.e., no side-effects) language, functions can be composed. That makes it possible to leverage patterns from mathematics.  This talk shows an algebra of function composition, identity functions, isomorphisms, (co)products (gluing functions that do not compose) and functors.  It shows how this algebra relates to real-world programming.  The goal of this talk is to provide an initial intuition of how to apply patterns from math to programming and to motivate you to continue studying on your own (perhaps by looking at the "uber" patterns of Category Theory).  Note: knowing these patterns is NOT necessary for getting work done in a functional language, but this talk should give a glimpse of why they may be useful.  The talk illustrates ideas using Haskell.  It is aimed at FP beginners.

                  Traditionally, in Computer Science, sets are assumed to be the basis of a type theory, together with Boolean logic. In this version of type theory, we do not need sets or Boolean logic; intuitionism is enough ("no principle of excluded middle required"). The underlying math is Topos Theory, but you are not required to be even aware of its existence. The theory is described using diagrams, not the traditional (and tricky) deduction rules. The resulting theory turns out to have dependent types. A simple "real-life" example or two will illustrate all this.

            </ul>

            <p>The city is very compact, making it easy to get around on foot or bicycle, and boasts an incredible variety of great dining options, local musicians, street performers, and live shows.</p>

            <p>Boulder has hundreds of miles of maintained hiking trails, is 30 minutes away from the nearest ski resort, and has one of the most physically active communities in America.</p>

            <h2>Airport</h2>

            <p>Boulder is served by the <a href="http://flydenver.com">Denver International Airport</a> (symbol: DEN).</p>

            <p>Low-cost national carriers into Denver include <a href="http://flyfrontier.com">Frontier Airlines</a> and <a href="http://southwest.com">Southwest</a>. These carriers fly from most major cities in the United States, and you can often find a round-trip fare for around $200.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/destinations/denver/flights-to-denver">British Airways</a> has direct, non-stop flights from London Heathrow to Denver.</p>

            <p>
              The best way of getting from the airport to Boulder is the <a href="http://www3.rtd-denver.com/schedules/getSchedule.action?routeId=AB">RTD Boulder AB Bus Route</a>. The bus takes about an hour and drops you off at the <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/boulder-transit-center-boulder-co/4b47e175f964a520a14226e3">Boulder Transit Station</a>, which is located in the heart of downtown Boulder, and a short walk away from our recommended hotels.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unless you will be staying outside of Boulder, you probably do not need to rent a car. Boulder is extremely walkable and bikable and also has excellent public transit options.
            </p>

              LambdaConf's code of conduct is simple: <strong>be a decent human being</strong>.</p>
            <p>
              Embrace and celebrate diversity, treat everyone with respect and dignity, and in the words you speak and the actions you take, show genuine care and concern for helping others achieve their goals.

              We have a zero tolerance policy towards written or spoken words, behaviors, artifacts, and media that make minority groups feel bullied, harassed, intimidated, stalked, stereotyped, or belittled. These groups include women, people of color, disabled individuals, lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals, asexuals, intersex people, transgender people, and gender-variant people.
            </p>

              Violations of this code of conduct should be reported immediately to conference volunteers or staff. All staff and volunteers will be wearing clearly marked <em>Team LambdaConf</em> apparel.
