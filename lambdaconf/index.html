                    <p>Boulder is served by the <a href="http://flydenver.com">Denver International Airport</a> (symbol: DEN). Low-cost carriers into Denver include <a href="http://flyfrontier.com">Frontier Airlines</a> and <a href="http://southwest.com">Southwest</a>. They fly from most major cities, and you can usually <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com/city/Denver-CO">find a roundtrip fare</a> for around $200.
                    <p>The best way of getting from the airport to Boulder is the <a href="http://www3.rtd-denver.com/schedules/getSchedule.action?routeId=AB">RTD Boulder AB Bus Route</a>. The bus takes about an hour and drops you off at the <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/boulder-transit-center-boulder-co/4b47e175f964a520a14226e3">Boulder Transit Station</a>, which is located in the heart of downtown Boulder, and a short walk away from our recommended hotels.</p>
                    <p>One of the best resources for people new to Boulder is the <a href="http://www.boulderdowntown.com">Boulder Downtown</a> website. You can find maps and routes, dining options, and much more.</p>
